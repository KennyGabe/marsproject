marsproject
===========

MARS which stands for Management Assistant and Recording System is a Java application that interacts with our client's database to add/update/delete records.
Database information will then be used to produce reports.

Once we start entering confidential information in the application we will then make this project private to the members of Nebula System Solutions.

To contribute in this project you must use the same Package, Classes, and Methods names in your computer so that we don't have to change those names back and forth.
